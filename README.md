# Mom Project

##### This is my first project using React Native. My mom recently passed away, and I've decided to create an app to remember her with.

# Features (for now):
1. I want to create a photos section that allows users to upload pictures to a shared album.
1. I want to have a messages section. One of the most difficult aspects of losing my mom has been the constant urge to text her followed by the realization that I can't. I'm going to build a one-way messaging system so that when I feel like I should text my mom, I can.
